# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 


First of all i clean the data, using filter and sort. Creating a new column for deadline and launched dates, converting from timestamp to regular date. So I could understand how the dates influence the outcomes of the plays, creating a new sheet with pivot table for the  Date Launched Statistics
Here I could found the months that most have successfull plays, since the client wanted to know the data from theater I also filterd by theater play, so you can check that May was the month that most have successfull plays and October has the most failed plays.

After that I created a conditional formatting for the outcomes column and porcentage funded.
Also divided the Category and Subcategory columns to two separated columns, parent category and subcategory columns
After, I created a Pivot table, using country on filter, outcomes on columns, parent category and outcomes for values. 
The category that had most successful was theater which helps the client.
I also did a Pivot table for Subcategory Statistics and plays was the most successfull outcome.
After that the client said they had interested in 5 different plays so I created anew sheet with their data: Edinburgh Research
 After that I wanted to know the outcome measure between the Goal and Pledged plays just in the US country, so I created a Successful US Kickstarters sheet and Failed US Kickstarters sheet
For analysing those information I created a new sheet Descriptive Statistics
There you can find central measures and also spread measures, so I created box and whisker chart to visualize the data to undestand the budget for the client's play.
